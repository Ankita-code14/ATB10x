### **Program Execution in case of Exception**

- `JVM will be Initialized (From RAM)`
- `//Creates and Starts the main Thread. - Main Called`
- `//1) Collects the Command Line Arguments - 10`
- `// String[] args = {10} ->`
- // 2) Lab204_Exception.main()
//Now Control will be transferred from **main Thread to main method**
// When problem comes in main -> JVM
- // **If you don't handle the exception** JVM will handle it
// **Always terminate the program with exception.**
MT -> main thread (Thread, Labor -> main Method) Got it - G
