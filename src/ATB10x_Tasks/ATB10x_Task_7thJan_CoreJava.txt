1) What is Source Code?

- Human understandable code written using High Level Programming language.
- In java - NameOfFile.java 
- Source code is something that human write . 
- You have to follow the rules of the programming language.
- Syntax - Rules that we have to follow. 


**Source Code** (NameOfFile.java) ->  Byte Code. ( JVM Can understand) -> **Native Code **(Machine), 0,1



2) What is Byte Code? 

Source Code (NameOfFile.java) ->  Byte Code. ( JVM Can understand) -> Native Code (Machine), 0,1

Bytecode is an intermediate, low-level representation of source code that is compiled and optimized for execution by a virtual machine (e.g., JVM in Java). 


It is not directly readable by humans or machines but is platform-independent and executed efficiently by interpreters or just-in-time compilers.


3) What is the native code?

- Code which NATIVE to the OS.
- Windows -NC -on window( .exe), dmg(mac), sh


4) What is Java Compiler?

Java Compiler is a program developed in C or C++ programming language with the name **“javac”**. It will check syntactic or grammatical errors of the programs. **It converts source code to byte code.** 


5) What is JIT Compiler?
JIT stands for Just-In-Time, and it's a compiler that improves the performance of Java applications. It does this by converting bytecode into native machine code while the program is running. 

6) Difference between Compiler and interpreter?
Compiler

The compiler displays all issues after compilation.
The compiler is based on the translation linking-loading paradigm
The compiler requires the entire programme
A compiler transforms high-level programming language code into machine code before a program’s execution.
Computed code runs faster


Interpreter

the interpreter displays issues for specific lines.
The Interpreter is based on the Interpretation Method.
The interpreter only needs one line of code.
In contrast, an interpreter transforms each high-level programme statement into machine code separately.
interpreted code runs slower than computed.
