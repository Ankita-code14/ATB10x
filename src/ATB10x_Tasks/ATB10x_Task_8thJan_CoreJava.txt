1) what is Keyword in java? 

 Reserved Words
		 * in Java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality such type of words are called reserved words
		 * Reserved Words - 53
		 * 				Keywords(50) 											Reserved Literals (3) (true, false, null)
		 * Used keywords(48)	Unused Keywords(2) (goto, const)
		 *  
		 * below used keywords categorizations
		 * 1. Keywords for DataTypes 8 - byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
		 * 2. Keywords for Flow Control 11 - if, else, switch, case, default, while, do, for, break, continue, return
		 * 3. Keywords for Modifiers 11 - public, private, protected, static, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, volatile (total 12 are their with default)
		 * 4. Keywords for Exception Handling 6 - try, catch, finally, throw, throws, assert
		 * 5. Class related Keywords 6 - class, interface, extends, implements, package, import
		 * 6. Object related Keywords 4 - new, instanceof, super, this
		 * 7. Return Type Keywords 1- void
		 * 
		 * goto - usage of goto created servral problems in old languages and hence some people band this keyword in java
		 * const - use of final instead of const 
		 * goto and const are unused keywords and if we are trying to used we will get compile time error
		 
		 
* Reserved Literals 
		 * true and false - values for boolean data type
		 * null - default value for object reference
		 * 
		 * 
		 * enum keyword - (1.5 v)- we can used enum to define a group of named constant
		 * e.g. enum month{
		 * 				jan, feb,....dec;
		 * 		}
		 * 


2) What is Identifiers in java? 
Identifiers
- names those will be used to identify the programming elements like classes, methods, variables, etc uniquely




3) where we can't use the keyword in a program? 
- We **canâ€™t use keywords** as names for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifiers. 


4) what is the rule for the identifier?
 Rules for defining Java Identifiers
		 * 1. only allowed characters in java identifiers are(A-Z, a-z, 0-9,$, _) if any other symbol 
		 * used then complied time error
		 * 2. Identifiers can't starts with digit (total123 - valid , 123Total- invalid)
		 * 3. Java Identifiers are case sensitive
		 * 4. there is no length limit for java identifier but its not recommended to 
		 * take too lengthy identifiers
		 * 5. We can't used reserved words as identifiers (e.g. int x =10 - valid, int if = 20 - invalid)
		 * 6. All predefine java class names and interface names we can use as identifiers  
		 * e.g int String = 888; - valid
		 * e.g int Runnable = 999; - valid 
		 * even though it is valid but it is not a good programming practice bcz it's reduces readability and creates 
		 * confusion
